    <h1>Tissue</h1>

    <p>In biology, tissue is a cellular organizational level between cells and a complete organ. A tissue is an ensemble
        of similar cells and their extracellular
        matrix from the same origin that together carry out a specific function. Organs are then formed by the
        functional grouping together of multiple tissues..</p>




    <h2>Epithelial tissue</h2>

    <p>The epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces, such as the surface of skin, the
        airways, surfaces of soft organs, the reproductive tract, and the inner lining of the digestive tract. The cells
        comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, tight junctions; hence, this tissue provides a
        barrier between
        the external environment and the organ it covers. In addition to this protective function, epithelial tissue
        may also be specialized to function in secretion, excretion and absorption. Epithelial tissue helps to protect
        organs from microorganisms, injury, and
        fluid loss.</p>


    <h2>Connective tissue</h2>

    <p>Connective tissues are fibrous tissues made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an
        extracellular matrix. This matrix can be liquid or rigid. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and
        bone's matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon,
        ligament, adipose, and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective
        tissues is
        to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective
        tissue.</p>


    <h2>Muscular tissue</h2>

    <p>Muscle cells form the active contractile tissue of the body known as muscle tissue or muscular tissue. Muscle
        tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle
        tissue is separated into three distinct categories: visceral or smooth muscle, found in the inner linings of
        organs; skeletal muscle, typically attached to bones, which generate gross movement; and cardiac muscle, found
        in the heart, where it contracts to pump blood throughout an animal</p>


    <h2>Neural tissue</h2>

    <p>Cells comprising the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system are classified as nervous (or neural)
        tissue. In the central nervous system, neural tissues form the brain and spinal cord. In the peripheral nervous
        system, neural tissues form the cranial nerves and spinal nerves, inclusive of the motor neurons.</p>
